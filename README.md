## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- You can use calc to position an absolutely positioned item a certain distance from the end: `left: calc(100% - 100px);`
- You can reverse the ordering of flex.
- SVGs will resize to its parent container if using flex so need to set width/height specifically.
- Simple form validation with regex.

### Continued development

- Regex will likely be an area where I will need to delve in further but I might venture there only when I need it.
- Form validation on the frontend is limited as JavaScript can be disabled, so of course validation must occur on the backend as well.
- I need to familiarize a bit more with positioning images/background images within a container.
